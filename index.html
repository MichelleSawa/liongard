    <h2>Automate Your Documentation </h2> 
    <p class="text_column">You're managing a ton of systems for each client. Roar's automation gives you deep configuration and status details for systems across the stack. Push this data directly where your team is looking in your PSA and Docs. With daily updates, your team will always have access to fresh, accurate data. </p> <br><br>
    
      <h2> Minimize User Error with Alerts</h2>
    <p class="text_column">Anyone can fat-finger a SonicWall version or forget to save their Cisco ASA running configuration. Minimize humor errors with Roar's alerts. You can even setup tickets to land directly in your PSA. </p><br> <br>
      <h2>Manage Clients at Scale with Reporting </h2>
    <p class="text_column"> Are all of the firewalls you're managing up to date? While this question may have plagued you for years, Roar's reporting now allows you to run system-level reports across your customer base.<br>
